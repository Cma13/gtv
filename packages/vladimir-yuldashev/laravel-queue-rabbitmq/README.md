## Installation

You can install this package via composer using this command:

```
composer require vladimir-yuldashev/laravel-queue-rabbitmq
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Add connection to `config/queue.php`:

```php
'connections' => [
    // ...

    'rabbitmq' => [
    
       'driver' => 'rabbitmq',
       'queue' => env('RABBITMQ_QUEUE', 'default'),
       'connection' => PhpAmqpLib\Connection\AMQPLazyConnection::class,
   
       'hosts' => [
           [
               'host' => env('RABBITMQ_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
               'port' => env('RABBITMQ_PORT', 5672),
               'user' => env('RABBITMQ_USER', 'guest'),
               'password' => env('RABBITMQ_PASSWORD', 'guest'),
               'vhost' => env('RABBITMQ_VHOST', '/'),
           ],
       ],
   
       'options' => [
           'ssl_options' => [
               'cafile' => env('RABBITMQ_SSL_CAFILE', null),
               'local_cert' => env('RABBITMQ_SSL_LOCALCERT', null),
               'local_key' => env('RABBITMQ_SSL_LOCALKEY', null),
               'verify_peer' => env('RABBITMQ_SSL_VERIFY_PEER', true),
               'passphrase' => env('RABBITMQ_SSL_PASSPHRASE', null),
           ],
           'queue' => [
               'job' => VladimirYuldashev\LaravelQueueRabbitMQ\Queue\Jobs\RabbitMQJob::class,
           ],
       ],
   
       /*
        * Set to "horizon" if you wish to use Laravel Horizon.
        */
       'worker' => env('RABBITMQ_WORKER', 'default'),
       'after_commit' => false,
    ],

    // ...    
],
```

### Optional Config

Optionally add queue options to the config of a connection.
Every queue created for this connection, get's the properties.

When you want to prioritize messages when they were delayed, then this is possible by adding extra options.

- When max-priority is omitted, the max priority is set with 2 when used.

```php
'connections' => [
    // ...

    'rabbitmq' => [
        // ...

        'options' => [
            'queue' => [
                // ...

                'prioritize_delayed' =>  false,
                'queue_max_priority' => 10,
            ],
        ],
    ],

    // ...    
],
```

When you want to publish messages against an exchange with routing-key's, then this is possible by adding extra options.

- When the exchange is omitted, RabbitMQ will use the `amq.direct` exchange for the routing-key
- When routing-key is omitted the routing-key by default is the `queue` name.
- When using `%s` in the routing-key the queue_name will be substituted.

> Note: when using exchange with routing-key, u probably create your queues with bindings yourself.

```php
'connections' => [
    // ...

    'rabbitmq' => [
        // ...

        'options' => [
            'queue' => [
                // ...

                'exchange' => 'application-x',
                'exchange_type' => 'topic',
                'exchange_routing_key' => '',
            ],
        ],
    ],

    // ...    
],
```

In Laravel failed jobs are stored into the database. But maybe you want to instruct some other process to also do
something with the message.
When you want to instruct RabbitMQ to reroute failed messages to a exchange or a specific queue, then this is possible
by adding extra options.

- When the exchange is omitted, RabbitMQ will use the `amq.direct` exchange for the routing-key
- When routing-key is omitted, the routing-key by default the `queue` name is substituted with `'.failed'`.
- When using `%s` in the routing-key the queue_name will be substituted.

> Note: When using failed_job exchange with routing-key, u probably need to create your exchange/queue with bindings
> yourself.

```php
'connections' => [
    // ...

    'rabbitmq' => [
        // ...

        'options' => [
            'queue' => [
                // ...

                'reroute_failed' => true,
                'failed_exchange' => 'failed-exchange',
                'failed_routing_key' => 'application-x.%s',
            ],
        ],
    ],

    // ...    
],
```

### Use your own RabbitMQJob class

Sometimes you have to work with messages published by another application.  
Those messages probably won't respect Laravel's job payload schema.
The problem with these messages is that, Laravel workers won't be able to determine the actual job or class to execute.

You can extend the build-in `RabbitMQJob::class` and within the queue connection config, you can define your own class.
When you specify an `job` key in the config, with your own class name, every message retrieved from the broker will get
wrapped by your own class.

An example for the config:

```php
'connections' => [
    // ...

    'rabbitmq' => [
        // ...

        'options' => [
            'queue' => [
                // ...

                'job' => \App\Queue\Jobs\RabbitMQJob::class,
            ],
        ],
    ],

    // ...    
],
```

An example of your own job class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Queue\Jobs;

use VladimirYuldashev\LaravelQueueRabbitMQ\Queue\Jobs\RabbitMQJob as BaseJob;

class RabbitMQJob extends BaseJob
{

    /**
     * Fire the job.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function fire()
    {
        $payload = $this->payload();

        $class = WhatheverClassNameToExecute::class;
        $method = 'handle';

        ($this->instance = $this->resolve($class))->{$method}($this, $payload);

        $this->delete();
    }
}

```

Or maybe you want to add extra properties to the payload:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Queue\Jobs;

use VladimirYuldashev\LaravelQueueRabbitMQ\Queue\Jobs\RabbitMQJob as BaseJob;

class RabbitMQJob extends BaseJob
{
   /**
     * Get the decoded body of the job.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function payload()
    {
        return [
            'job'  => 'WhatheverFullyQualifiedClassNameToExecute@handle',
            'data' => json_decode($this->getRawBody(), true)
        ];
    }
}
```

## Laravel Usage

Once you completed the configuration you can use Laravel Queue API. If you used other queue drivers you do not need to
change anything else. If you do not know how to use Queue API, please refer to the official Laravel
documentation: http://laravel.com/docs/queues

## Laravel Horizon Usage

Starting with 8.0, this package supports [Laravel Horizon](http://horizon.laravel.com) out of the box. Firstly, install
Horizon and then set `RABBITMQ_WORKER` to `horizon`.

## Lumen Usage

For Lumen usage the service provider should be registered manually as follow in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(VladimirYuldashev\LaravelQueueRabbitMQ\LaravelQueueRabbitMQServiceProvider::class);
```

## Consuming Messages

There are two ways of consuming messages.

1. `queue:work` command which is Laravel's built-in command. This command utilizes `basic_get`.

2. `rabbitmq:consume` command which is provided by this package. This command utilizes `basic_consume` and is more
   performant than `basic_get` by ~2x.

## Testing

Setup RabbitMQ using `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
```

To run the test suite you can use the following commands:

```bash
# To run both style and unit tests.
composer test

# To run only style tests.
composer test:style

# To run only unit tests.
composer test:unit
```

If you receive any errors from the style tests, you can automatically fix most,
if not all of the issues with the following command:

```bash
composer fix:style
```
